# Recon Map Icons – Tactical Deployment Set

This repository contains a clean, structured set of tactical map icons, color-coded for operational deployment in mapping systems like Google Earth, KML/KMZ files, and GIS applications.

## Structure

- **/yellow/** – Venues, hotels, and general low-risk points of interest
- **/red/** – Hospitals, trauma centers, emergency response nodes
- **/purple/** – Embassy and consulate locations for international coordination

Each color folder contains numbered icons (`number_1.png` through `number_30.png`) for flexible assignment.

## Usage

You can reference these icons directly via GitHub RAW links for use in KML, KMZ, or mapping software:
